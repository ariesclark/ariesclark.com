						I&apos;m Aries, a {getYearSince(birthday)}-year-old Canadian with a burning desire to
						improve the status of the web through software development. I began developing software
						when I was pretty young, at the age of eleven. I&apos;ve done a lot of various things in
						those {getYearSince(new Date(birthday.getFullYear() + 11, 1, 1))} years, from building
						Minecraft mods in Java to writing a lot of terrible PHP websites to where I am now.
					</span>
					<br />
					<br />
					<span>
						Recently, I&apos;ve been concentrating on using current languages like TypeScript to
						build web-based applications and services using React and Next.js, among other tools.
						Here are a few technologies I&apos;ve been working with recently:
