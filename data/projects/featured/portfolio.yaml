  Prior to this project; I never really had a professional digital presence to demonstrate my capabilities at all. The design was quite heavily inspired by [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com)'s stunning portfolio. Using her portfolio as the baseline for the visual aspects I built up from scratch using Next.js, Tailwind.css and TypeScript within a couple days.
