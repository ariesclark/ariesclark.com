  After joining the official [Next.js discord](https://discord.gg/PRBZDsMHnH), I was informed about the monthly GitHub Discussion for posting Next.js job requests. Intrugied by the way they're using GitHub Discussions, I decided to smash open VS Code to design and implement an interface for all this lovely data made publicly available in a somewhat neat format.
